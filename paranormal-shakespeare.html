        <p>It's hard going down in history as The Shrew, especially since Katherine was born in the 21st century. After being left at the alter in a foreign country, Kate flees the church to escape the humiliation, but after a couple wrong turns she realizes not only does she not know where she is, she doesn't know when she is.</p>
        <p>Petruchio, the first heir to Hemsworth Manor is forced by the ruling family to take a wife within a fortnight to unify the city. If he refuses, his family could lose all they have worked for, or worse. With only a handful of choices, he flees Padua to decide what his next move will be.  Two worlds collide and Petruchio is left with an even bigger choice, marry from the undesirable collection that has been chosen for him, or risk it all on a beautiful madwoman.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Juliet is used to being ignored. She's lived a life of solitude for centuries. When Romeo walks into her life, things start to change and she's able to feel again. But with that feeling comes a pain she's not ready to deal with. As mysterious events begin to unfold, she'll need to undertake a journey to uncover her past, so she can finally be able to stop her future.</p>
        <p>Romeo isn't quite sure what to make of Juliet. But when she is cast as the lead in the school play alongside him, unexplainable things start to happen. He's either going crazy, or her illogical rantings are actually true. And if that's the case, he'll have to fight the clock to save her from herself.</p>
