Johanna Evelyn graduated from the school of hard knocks with a degree in, I survived my twenties. She loves all things rocks, the ocean, singing, reading, service, gardening, food, finding cures for rare incurable diseases (through raising awareness, Go PSC!), and writing. She gets most of her book ideas from dreams, then adds a little of herself to every story. 

She is afraid to admit she doesn't like dogs, but tolerates cats, and watches more I shouldn't be alive, and untold stories of the ER, than is probably good for her dramatic sensibilities.

She is the mother of six children who keep her on her toes most of the time. And the wife to a man who doesn't understand why she's always trying to change the endings of the movies she doesn't like, or reading the last page of the book before deciding to read it.
